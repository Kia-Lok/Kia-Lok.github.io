title: About Myself

## How do you look like?
* Unfortunately I am not photogenic so I only really have unglams of myself to post 😅.
* Also, I prefer some privacy since this is on a public repository so I will not include my image here.

## Tell me briefly about yourself.
* I am Max, a NUS Student that enjoys learning mathematics and coding. Particularly, I am interested in the field of AI and High Performance Computing.
* Currently going through broadly what the field of AI entails, though particularly interested in Reinforcement Learning and Data Science applications. Also learning CUDA (and hopefully Triton soon!) using online GPUs (It somehow works out!)
* I love Japanese media and currently picking up Japanese and hope to reach native level one day. 

## What can I find in the write-ups?
* Write-ups on research that I have read up on and want to comment about or just find a place to save for future references.
* A less technical write-up of codes I have written and stored in my repository where I will document the process of reaching the end product.
* Involvements I have related to tech that I want to share.
