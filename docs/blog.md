title: Write-ups
---

Welcome to the main page containing all my write-ups! I broadly categorised the write-ups into three types: Knowledge, Technical and Fluff.

## Knowledge

This section contains write-ups containing knowledge that I have learnt related to AI/ML/HPC and want to store it for future references should I need to revisit the topics again.

- [Understanding Neural Networks](/blog/knowledge-sharing/example-article) - Fundamentals of neural networks and their applications

## 💻 Technical Work

Documentation of projects I've built, including architecture decisions, implementation details, and results.

- [Building a GPU-Accelerated Pipeline](/blog/technical-work/example-project) - Optimizing computational pipelines with GPU acceleration

## 😄 Fluff

Casual thoughts, observations, and musings about tech culture, learning, and life.
